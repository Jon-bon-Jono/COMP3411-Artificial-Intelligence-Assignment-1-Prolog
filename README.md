# COMP3411-Artificial-Intelligence-Assignment-1-Prolog
Prolog programs to perform some list and tree operations. The aim of the assignment is to give experience with typical Prolog programming techniques. 

## Question 1.1: List Processing
Write a predicate sumsq_even(Numbers, Sum) that sums the squares of only the even numbers in a list of integers.
- Example: `sumsq_even([1,3,5,2,-4,6,8,-7], Sum).Sum = 120`

## Question 1.2: List Processing
Write a predicate log_table(NumberList,ResultList) that binds ResultList to the list of pairs consisting of a number and its log, for each number in NumberList. 
- Example: `log_table([1, 3.7, 5], Result).`
-- `Result = [[1, 0.0], [3.7, 1.308332819650179], [5, 1.6094379124341003]].`
